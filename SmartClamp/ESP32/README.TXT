This code is meant to work with Esspresifâ€™s ESP32 Dev Board V4 with ESP32-WROOM-32D core. 

PlatformIO is needed to flash the ESP32 with the source code and the required libraries.

PlatformIO is an add-on for Atom or VSCode. It is really helpful as it automatically retrieves and installs libraries for you an allow compile and troubleshoot the same code for different hardware. This can all be defined in the platformio.ini file.
