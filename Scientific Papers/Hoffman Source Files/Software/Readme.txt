The turbidostat.ino needs to be flashed onto the Arduino Nano with the Arduino IDE. 
Make sure, the proper driver for the Arduino Nano's chip is installed.

The 'Turbidostat' folder needs to be placed into the current user's home directory. 
(E.g. under Windows typically C:\Users\'UserX')

Start the GUI with the console from the GUI directory with the command 'python turbidostat.py'.

A python distribution containing the used libraries has to be installed.
